This is the documentation for the chaos pendulum project on

git@github.com:tychon/chaospendel.git

It is a separate project, to separate the code history from some big images.

You need some different programs to get the makefile in doc-ger/ running:

* some latex compiler with some extra packages
* python
* ImageMagick: convert
* dia
